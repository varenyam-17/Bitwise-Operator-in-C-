# Experiment-4
Aim:To study and implement C++ Bitwise Operators.
Theory:In C++, bitwise operators are used to perform operations directly on the binary representations of integers. These operators are especially useful in low-level programming, such as system programming, embedded systems, and performance-critical code.
The bitwise AND (&) operator compares each bit of two numbers and returns a new number whose bits are set to 1 only if both corresponding bits were 1. The bitwise OR (|) operator sets each bit to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits is 1. The bitwise XOR (^) operator sets each bit to 1 only if the corresponding bits are different. The bitwise NOT (~) operator inverts all the bits of a number, turning 1s into 0s and vice versa.
Additionally, C++ provides bitwise shift operators: the left shift (<<) moves bits to the left, effectively multiplying the number by powers of two, while the right shift (>>) moves bits to the right, dividing the number by powers of two.
