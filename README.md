# Experiment-4
Aim:To study and implement C++ Bitwise Operators.
Theory:In C++, bitwise operators are used to perform operations directly on the binary representations of integers. These operators are especially useful in low-level programming, such as system programming, embedded systems, and performance-critical code.
The bitwise AND (&) operator compares each bit of two numbers and returns a new number whose bits are set to 1 only if both corresponding bits were 1. The bitwise OR (|) operator sets each bit to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits is 1. The bitwise XOR (^) operator sets each bit to 1 only if the corresponding bits are different. The bitwise NOT (~) operator inverts all the bits of a number, turning 1s into 0s and vice versa.
Additionally, C++ provides bitwise shift operators: the left shift (<<) moves bits to the left, effectively multiplying the number by powers of two, while the right shift (>>) moves bits to the right, dividing the number by powers of two.
Algorithm:~>
- Start
- Input two integer values: a and b
- Perform the following bitwise operations:
- AND (a & b) → Store and display result
- OR (a | b) → Store and display result
- XOR (a ^ b) → Store and display result
- NOT (~a) and ~b → Store and display result
- Left Shift (a << n) → Shift a by n positions and display
- Right Shift (b >> n) → Shift b by n positions and display
- Display all results with proper labels
- End
Conclusion: C++ Bitwise Operators
Studying and implementing bitwise operators in C++ deepens your understanding of how computers handle data at the binary level. These operators—such as &, |, ^, ~, <<, and >>—are powerful tools for tasks involving low-level data manipulation, performance optimization, and algorithmic efficiency.
By experimenting with bitwise operations, you strengthen your grasp of:
- Binary number systems
- Logical patterns and control
- Efficient coding practices often used in system programming, cryptography, graphics, and embedded systems
